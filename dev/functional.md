Functional programming is a _ programming paradigm_. A paradigm is a
broad characterisation of a language and its features. The functional
programming paradigm falls in the category of _declarative_ languages,
in which the program is more a description of computation than a
sequential set of instructions. Functional programming languages are
characterised by mathematically pure first-class functions.

# First-class Functions

Functions in functional programming are considered _first-class_ -
functions can be passed to and returned from other functions and bound
to variables, just as any other data type.

# Purely Functional Programming

Purely functional programming is a subset of the functional programming
paradigm, in which functions are _pure_ or
[mathematically](/maths/relations.md#functions) deterministic. Functions
in many imperative languages are more accurately described as
procedures, because they do not satisfy the definition of mathematical
functions and may cause side-effects. Pure functions cal

# Higher-order Functions

A higher-order function simply takes a function as an argument or
returns a function.

# Partial Application & Currying

# Referential Transparency

Generally, variables in functional programming are immutable. The value
of a variable cannot be modified once defined. Consequently, every
occurrence of a variable in a functional program can be replaced with
its value - a situation know as referential transparency.
